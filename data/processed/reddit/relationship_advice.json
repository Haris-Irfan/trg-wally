        "text": "My boyfriend ( M37 ) and I ( F30 ) have been dating for 8 months. Things can sometimes be tumultuous but we generally have a good time together, we have similar values and treat each other well. \n\nWe have a reoccurring challenge that I frame as a lack of community from him and that he frames as a lack of prioritisation on my side. I let him know that I will be at a sleepover with my best friends on the weekend since one of them isn\u2019t having a great time and we\u2019d like to cheer her up. I could hear his disappointment over the phone when he said \u2018I don\u2019t operate as someone in a relationship and I want to have my cake and eat it since I should be hanging out with him over the weekend\u2019. I spent the whole of last weekend with him, I saw him during the week, we talk for at least an hour everyday multiple times throughout the day and I will be spending some time next week on a holiday I planned for us. \n\nI\u2019m struggling with fulfilling his time needs because my other relationships with my friends and family are important to me. How do I maintain my other relationships while also helping my partner feel fulfilled that he\u2019s also a priority and important to me?",

That's part of the problem with oversimplifying all relationship problems down to their age gap - it assumes that older women are immune to being abused. They're not! Being abused is not a matter of being immature or stupidity. It can happen to anyone, and the fact that OP is well past the point of full maturity hasn't helped her to learn how to spot this bullshit when it happens. So bringing up their ages here is irrelevant, because the common advice that \"older women would know better and that's why he goes for younger women\" doesn't apply because OP *is* old enough by any metric. \n\nSo bringing up their age gap in this context is a pointless distraction.

Yes, sometimes those feelings of insecurity can stem from controlling behavior\u2014but other times, they can be a sign that someone simply needs to build the muscles of confidence, security, and trust in their relationship.\n\nIn my case, my partner helped me work through those feelings in a really loving and patient way. He consistently reassured me that our relationship was solid, and that him spending time with others wasn\u2019t a sign that he didn\u2019t enjoy being with me. He understood my feelings, but he also didn\u2019t stop being social or abandon the friendships that were important to him. That balance\u2014of being empathetic without sacrificing his own identity\u2014was what ultimately helped me grow. I learned that his love for his friends didn\u2019t take anything away from his love for me. It was never a competition; it was about making space for different kinds of meaningful relationships. And that shift in perspective made me stronger and deepened our relationship.\n\nOver time, I became a more secure and independent person because he didn\u2019t shame me for my insecurities\u2014he helped me work through them. And I\u2019ve also helped him grow in different areas. That\u2019s one of my favorite things about having a long-term partner: when it\u2019s healthy, you help each other become better people through patience, trust, understanding, and example.\n\nNow, of course, there\u2019s an important caveat here. I\u2019m absolutely not suggesting that anyone should stay in a relationship that is abusive, toxic, or controlling. Everyone deserves to be treated with love and respect. But I do think we sometimes give up on people too quickly\u2014expecting them to come fully formed with every quality we want\u2014rather than recognizing that we\u2019re all flawed, and we all have areas where we can mature and grow. And in a healthy relationship, we can grow together.\n\nSo, while I can\u2019t speak to the specifics of your situation, I\u2019d just say: try to discern whether your partner is genuinely a good person with a good heart who needs a little growth\u2014or whether their behavior is crossing into territory that makes you feel unsafe or devalued. If it\u2019s the former, maybe there\u2019s a chance to work through it together. If it\u2019s the latter, it may be time to step away. Only you can make that call\u2014but whatever you decide, I hope you choose what brings you peace, confidence, and long-term growth.",

This is typical isolating behavior from a controlling individual and please know that this will escalate. The fact that you are objecting to this and letting him know it's not healthy is really really healthy of you and shows that you are far healthier emotionally than he is. \n\nIt's important to understand that every moment we choose to spend with someone in our lives is a gift. Is the gift of our time to them. They don't get to demand more. That's what boundaries are for and I have learned over the decades of boundaries are far more important in a relationship than that togetherness because they show whether someone respects you and your boundaries. \n\nWe are some total of all the experiences we have ever had. And one person in our lives in a romantic relationship cannot meet our needs for all the socialization and friendships that we need. A relationship should celebrate everything each of us are as separate people and our experiences with other people add to our happiness in a relationship, they do not take away from it. \n\nHe is dead wrong here, and you are better out of this relationship because his behavior needs to be dealt with in therapy and he needs to learn that he doesn't get to bully you or other women. Because he will because he already is. That's who he is. And now that he has shown you who he is you need to end this relationship and move on and explore the world and enjoy your friends and what life has to offer.

It's not like she's talking about getting drunk and crashing with the coworker who keeps texting at all hours of the night that she won't shut up about.  Personally, I wish I had friends who didn't live too far away or weren't too busy with kids to still have sleepovers.  (Which is probably also what will happen to OP's peer group by the time she's ready to get married, so maybe this guy just shouldn't be dating so far out of his age bracket if this is a problem for him.)",

Both things at the same time.\n\nMy advice is to think less about \"which one of us is right\" and think more about \"What is the compromise that gives both of us enough of what we want to be happy?\" If he can't think of a viable compromise, then he's being controlling, If YOU can't think of a viable compromise, then you're wanting to have your cake and eat it too. If neither one of you can think of a viable compromise, then you're simply incompatible.\n\nDespite what Reddit will tell you, people have different visions of what a partnership is like, and that's okay. My wife likes to go on girls trips with her friends and stay up deep into the night at her friends' houses or at parties without me. My mother, by contrast, refused to go on trips or to parties without my father because, as she put it, \"I married him because I want to spend time with HIM, not with other people.\" Both my wife and my mother are healthy people with healthy relationships, and it's not Reddit's place to call one vision \"too controlling.\" That said, you have to reach a compromise within the confines of your own relationship, or else this issue will continue to be a wedge that drives you apart.",

        "title": "I (20f) am starting to feel resentful of my girlfriend(20f) because of how little she showers. Any advice?",
        "text": "EDIT: I apologize for any confusion but 1 shower a month was the worst it\u2019s gotten. She usually showers once every 2/3 weeks, which is still pretty bad in my opinion\n\nAlso: I brought up my job because it causes me to shower more often, I work with food so I always shower after work (I work ~20 hrs a week)\n\nI feel incredibly guilty about this entire situation and I need some guidance. My girlfriend and I have been together for almost 3 years. We\u2019re both college students who live together with 7 roommates (yes I know but rent is cheap this way lol). We both have our own room, which I can appreciate because I like my alone time. The bathroom her and I (and two other roommates) share is just down the hall from her room. I love my girlfriend dearly, but she showers so infrequently that it makes it difficult to be around her some times. On average, she showers once a month. For contrast, I shower about once every 2 days ish (depending on my work schedule, I\u2019m a line cook). It\u2019s becoming a bigger issue because I\u2019m not enjoying the time I spend with her as much because of the smell. Her resistance to showering is also making me resent her.\n\nI initially assumed she was struggling with her mental health, so I tried everything I could to help with that. She has unmedicated ADHD (long story but medication doesn\u2019t seem to help) and I figured that was a big contributing factor. I struggled with depression in the past so I know what it\u2019s like to lose control of your hygiene. I offered to do her laundry, wash her hair in the shower, help her with any task that may make the act of taking a shower easier for her. Up until now I\u2019ve kept this a private matter, in an attempt to not embarrass her.\n\nI\u2019ve asked what could possibly be stopping her from showering and she\u2019s told me multiple times it\u2019s not a matter of mental health. She said (and I quote) \u201cWhen I don\u2019t shower for a bit, I get used to it, so I don\u2019t think I need to shower\u201d. For some reason this really frustrated me. She also said she gets upset when I ask her to shower because it makes her not want to shower at all. Admittedly, I think I\u2019ve been a little pushy about this issue in the past. At the same time, it shouldn\u2019t be my responsibility to make sure an adult showers regularly.\n\nShe is unemployed and we both are getting a humanities degree, so it\u2019s not a matter of not having the time either. She definitely does have the time, because she plays video games from the time she wakes up to the time she goes to bed. The fact that she smells to other people (my roommates brought it up) doesn\u2019t seem to bother her enough to get her to shower.\n\nI\u2019m not exactly sure when all of this started, but I think it started around sophomore year of college (a year and a half ago roughly) when we moved into an apartment type dorm. All I want is for her to be consistent with her showering so I can better enjoy spending time with her. I care about her deeply and I\u2019d never want to leave her, but this can\u2019t go on forever. Resentment doesn\u2019t feel good for either of us. Any suggestions help! \n",

I can smell the room from here. The socks!!! The in-boob smell!!! The crack!!! I cannot comprehend how. I'm beyond disgusted. I am considering skipping all the questions about showering starting now. Ugh.\n\nFor OP, I cannot recommend enough to have enough self respect to keep yourself around people with enough self respect. It is a thing. Other people's opinions shouldn't be your concern. (like your gf's opinion on body cleanliness) Meanwhile you can let others know and not shower for a whole month and see if she likes it. Let her smellllll the stink. (It's a joke but it's satisfying to imagine)",

The phrase that stuck out to me was \u201cshe gets upset when I ask her to shower because it makes her not want to shower at all.\u201d  Look up Pathological Demand Avoidance.  Can be common in individuals with ADHD/autism.  Basically, and request by you will be seen as a demand and will be compulsively resisted, for reasons unknown even to themselves.  I dealt with this in a relationship and it didn\u2019t end well.  Basically they could not bring themselves to meet a core need of mine that was easy to accomplish, simply because of this compulsion.  (It was on the order of texting me back, or planning a date night once every other week.)\n\nIf you can\u2019t reasonably feel secure that your partner will compromise to meet a deep need of yours in the relationship, you will never feel safe or considered at the end of the day. She needs to bring more to the table than companionship to truly be a life partner. This is not it.",

She's genetically blessed with the ability to smell absolutely vile and her she's also not too critical and also said 'eu I don't smell myself'. So I just started sending her to shower: No shower, no sex. I love you but I'm gagging here.\n\nAlso with laundry, she has shitty standards so I just do the laundry most of the time.\n\nI used to stink as well in my puberty, but then I discovered Old Spice deodorant + some other 'specialized' brands. They're great and I make my GF use them.\n\nMy GF suffers from depression but is still very receptive to my feedback and does her best. I also used to suffer from (a different type of) depression + I have add and aspergers syndrome, so I guarantee you: If she and you do your actual best, it's not a problem at all.\n\nAlso: as a line cook you also need to shower every day.\n\nI case you don't my a little white lie: tell her the doctor said she's giving you some kind of skin affliction and you both need to shower every day.",

Don't tell her she smells bad, or make icky face when she gets rank. Act like nothing is happening, and if you can't be with her because the stink is bad, just let her know you can't be with her. You don't have to say why you can't be with her, just separate and do something else.\n\nNext up, find out WHY she's not showering.\n\nWhy isn't she showering? Ask her, not to find a reason to counter her, but to listen. Five Whys: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five\\_whys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_whys)\n\nYou're going to have guide her to shower more, but if you talk poorly or be passive aggressive about her deciding to not shower she's going to keep fighting it, and it could get worse.\n\nIt's like Inception if you gotta make showering her idea with positive reinforcement of her ACTIONS.\n\nGive it 6 months of letting her do her thing and not pushing her to shower more. If her showering doesn't get better then you need to accept she won't shower and either embrace it or break up.",

Unmedicated ADHD will make you do things like this, along with hyperfixation and avoidant tendencies, coming from someone who was once unmedicated and doing similar, albeit the longest I went without a shower was a week. She needs to cut out the video games for a bit and get into a routine, and possibly see a therapist to help discuss these things and why she\u2019s frequently avoiding showering. But this is also not your responsibility OP and she needs to do this for herself, especially if you\u2019ve been trying to help them with this with no results.

Shampoo, body wash, condition, brush teeth. All of it. \n\nFor some reason, keeping up his hygiene was something he would not do.

        "text": "Throwaway account because people we know use reddit and I don\u2019t want them to know about our sex life. My husband and I have been married for almost 2 years now and nothing like this has happened in our relationship before. We have always been very open with each other, as we both like to hash out problems before they escalate. One of the first things that drew me to him was his brutal honesty. We also have (or had) a pretty regular and healthy sex life - never having problems with infidelity or anything of a similar vein. In short, our relationship is more or less perfect. \n\nUntil the other night. My husband and I were going at it, when said something pretty strange. Everything was normal until I heard him moan \u201chooby dooby.\u201d At first I thought that I had misheard him, but no. He completely froze and looked mortified, I was just confused. Mood ruined. I asked him about it but all he did was take his pillow and leave. I knew he was going to sleep on the couch, which isn\u2019t something he\u2019s had to do since we first moved in together (not gonna get into that). We spent the night apart and in the morning went about our routines as normal. When he got home from work I tried to bring it up but he pretended not to hear me and kept watching TV.\n\nIt\u2019s been a couple of days and I haven\u2019t brought it up since. However, there\u2019s been an air of awkwardness between us and I don\u2019t think we can truly move past this without discussing it. I was hoping he\u2019d be the one to bring it up first but that hasn\u2019t been the case.\n\nI don\u2019t know what \u201chooby dooby\u201d means, I have theories about maybe it being an anime character as he enjoys watching that kind of stuff, but to me it doesn\u2019t sound like someone\u2019s name. If anyone knows what or who \u201chooby dooby\u201d is, or has any ideas on how to approach this with him, please let me know. Thank you.",

I don't think it's out of the question that he said something nonsensical in such a state. If that's what ends up being his explanation, I'd say reassure him that he doesn't have to be fully \"on\" when it comes to lovemaking, and it's okay for him to have lapses that cause him to say or do something goofy.",

        "text": "How do I (23F) tell my boyfriend (25M) that I don\u2019t like having sex with him anymore?\n\nSo my (23F) bf (25M) has a very high sex drive. I do not\u2026 anymore. When we met I was a virgin and after our first time, we went kinda crazy. I\u2019m talking 4-5 times a day, 3-4 days a week. We were constantly talking about it and touching and teasing each other. You know, the honeymoon phase. And I thought he was good about taking care of me but looking back, he would only go down on me for short periods before \u201cgiving up\u201d and he said it was too hard to rub my cl*t while having sex. \n\nThose should\u2019ve been the only red flags I needed but alas, we\u2019ve been together for a year now. My drive has slowed a LOT, like, I prefer maybe once or twice a week. He constantly complains about us not having sex enough. When we do, it is imperative that I go down on him, if I express that I don\u2019t feel like it, he gets huffy and puffy and makes me feel bad until I finally give in. \n\nA few weeks ago, he held my head to make me keep going after he finished and literally pissed in my mouth instead of finishing a second time. Afterwards I told him I didn\u2019t want to do that again (i literally threw up) and made it obvious I wasnt in the mood to continue. But again, he guilted me into having sex with him to make him feel like he was \u201cnormal.\u201d Just a few days ago, it happened again, but I stood my ground about not continuing and he got very upset and wouldnt speak to me for the rest of the evening. \n\nOn top of that, he never goes down on me anymore. We have a toy for me but he complains that he can\u2019t finish if we use it, and makes me feel awkward because I have to ask if we can, he doesnt bring it up himself. He also complains a TON when I ask him to use a condom, usually until I give in again. We do whatever position he wants, for however long he wants, and once he\u2019s done, it\u2019s over, he goes and showers and then goes to sleep. \n\nAll of this is making me not want to engage in any sexual activity with him anymore. I\u2019ve tried multiple times to talk to him about it what I need and he apologizes but doesnt change his behavior. I haven\u2019t straight up told him I don\u2019t want to anymore and I don\u2019t know if that is even worth it. In addition to some other things, I\u2019m starting to think this could be a reason to break up. \n\nHopefully this makes sense, any and all advice is appreciated <3\n\nETA: \nyes, pissed in my mouth. he said after that it was an accident and that he thought he was going to cum again. the second time, i asked him if he had finished (surprisingly i couldnt tell) he said no and pushed my head back down, and then did it again, again saying it was an accident and he didnt even realize \n\nill address more comments in the morning, i appreciate all the support & YES i am making a plan to break up with him! \n\nEdit 2: First of all, again, I appreciate the support, harsh or not. \nSecond, after a long chat with my therapist yesterday, we came to the conclusion that he has been mentally/emotionally abusing and manipulating me for a long time in a lot of different ways. the responses to this post gave me enough confidence to tell her about this abuse as well. And we are working on a plan to process it all. BF and I live together (worst decision ive made i know) so I am planning on silently packing my stuff this weekend and getting out. \nThird, about the piss. I\u2019m going to continue to mention that this is my FIRST sexual partner. How am I supposed to know it\u2019s not natural, especially after googling it and seeing that it can happen? He acted embarrassed after so I just did what I could to comfort him while expressing I didnt like it and dont want to do it again. Also, luckily I could tell the difference between the feeling of it and cum, so I didnt swallow it, just fyi. \nFinally, those of you saying things about \u201cwhy do women\u201d shut up. why do men? why does this man that i thought loved me choose to constantly manipulate, abuse, and degrade me? why isnt HE normal? i grew up with a narcissistic mother and it, by default, makes me more susceptible to falling for a partner with the same tendencies. It\u2019s not a choice, it\u2019s truly what I believe(d) that I deserve. I AM working on it, and this plan to leave is the first step. dont blame me for what he is doing to me, or say women in general are weak for staying in a situation that you have never endured, therefore know nothing about. i\u2019ll try to update when i am safely away, thanks again",

Please get out as soon as you can! \n\nYou don't have to tell him anything but if you want to, I wouldn't even suggest saying it to his face, he doesn't deserve that. I suggest writing out everything you want to say about everything he's done to you, how it's made you feel and then making sure you send exactly that and don't respond to anything he says after, because he will try to gaslight you, deny it, send VNs of him crying or whatever else he can do to manipulate you into staying. Don't give him the chance to do so. Then say you'll be over with a friend to pick up your stuff. If you live together, go to a friend's place or go hang out with a friend, send him the text and say your friend will be coming with you to pick up your stuff. \n\nIt's not an easy thing to realise that you've been assaulted by a bf but you will be okay and you will get through it!

Is that date further in the past than the last time you had sex and he finished.\n\nBecause if sex in your relationship has been defined around his orgasm and not yours then is it really sex for you? Or are you just his fleshlight?  Is it really sex for you, or is it charity? Is he a lover or really a client who pays shit. Relationships are a partnership and it seems that your sex life is a one way obligation. \n\nYou worry about a nice way of telling him you aren't interested in shitty sex anymore. But he is totally ok to consistently be shit at sex. He goes into sex and gets what he wants and knows you were frustrated, disappointed and sometimes disgusted and is ok with that and does it again.  He does not consider if you have a good time. Each time he knew he was the only person who enjoyed himself and chose not the change the next time, again, and again, and again. \n\nAre you internalizing guilt feeling like the onus is on you that you didn't use the right words to make your partner give a damn if you have an orgasm? \n\nI sound angry, but it's on your behalf, because past me put up with that BS for so long and I felt bad I didn't communicate. But if my partner doesn't finish, I would know and I would think about how I could do better, alter technique, check into their medication because I cared. \n\nWhy be polite? The man is demanding monogamy and can't deliver your orgasms. He is a shitty lover and you don't want to be saddled with bad sex for the rest of your life, so you are ending the relationship.\n\nI am fast forwarding you to break up so you miss the inevitable next steps inbetween-\n\nYou have a serious face to face conversation telling him that his penis does not enter anywhere in your body, not even a handy, until after he has brought you to orgasm so you can be certain you both will get your enjoyment from that shared intimacy. \n\nHe will say the right things about changing during that conversation, not enthusiastically and may even buy the book 'She Comes First's which they will not finish. \n\nA few days later you get to have some cute arguments where he wakes you up for a quickly where you make it clear the rule is being enforced and he better get down there. After that you have another argument where he will push for a quick blowjob to help them get to sleep and huff when you pull out the vibrator and tell him to get started. \n\nThen the sex will stop when they realise you are enforcing mutually satisfying sex or none at all. Just stop. They may try for one or two, you may get one or two orgasms from rushed foreplay before they get back to being star of the ahow, but they will use a midnight quickie or whatever to ease it back into their comfortable pattern of acting like you are the walking fleshlight in their porno. Or you will enforce the rule and have another argument. Either way, chances are that change will not last.\n\nBecause they were spoiled for too long, had their needs met too well without caring about reciprocity, they will choose masturbating over mutually satisfying sex. You will resent them. The relationship will die slowly. So just skip those steps.",

I however had to every single time and then was just bent over while standing until he finally finished. I faked so many times just to hurry him along. About 3-4 years into it I gave up wanting him to pleasure me, it wasn\u2019t going to happen. He took over my entire life, all my energy and all my confidence. He would bring home animals he secretly bought (separate bank accounts) and then bring them home for me to have to take care of, train, vet visits, purchase food for and everything that goes into having pets. We now have 4 German Shepherds and 3 cats!! That\u2019s 7 animals that I have had to deal with. I love them more than I love him, so not a total loss. I caught him cheating 3 times in our relationship. The last time was the last time, I was done being his slave. I cooked, cleaned, managed the yard work (9 acres of forest) shopped, trained dogs, waited on him hand and foot with nothing more then complaining about what I had done. Like always commenting on the meals I made, I am professionally trained as a chef, or complaining about the price of goods going up even tho I paid for most things in the home. All this while working a full time job. He works and makes good money now but he didn\u2019t the first 3 years. I\u2019ve paid the price. I\u2019m done.

This is the right take moving forward. While yes, you should be more comfortable breaking up with guys that treat you poorly moving forward -- the ultimate question is indeed \"why do men\"! Men do horrible things to us and we get blamed for tolerating it and holding out hope he'll start respecting you one day -- well that's one reason why women stay! We get blamed for EVERYTHING. So having self confidence is hard when men will literally abuse us and we get blamed for it.\n\nI'm so happy for you that you saw through the bullshit and are ready to leave him.

Our sex life is actually amazing and I want nothing honestly to change. She is my everything and my whole world and I would never want to hurt her. That brings me to my issue above.\n\nMy wife is around 250 to 260 lbs right now. We have 2 amazing kids. I want her to spend the rest of my life with me and I am afraid of the negative health issues that being overwieght will lead to long term. \n\nI am myself about 195 lbs and 5 foot 8 inches. Im not thin, im not fat, I look pretty average. I say this so you dont think I have a double standard. \n\nMy wife struggles with keeping up with the boys. Multiple times one will run off in a store and she cannot keep up and he just \"gets away\" from her.\n\n1 time her and her dad lost him when they took him shopping without me cause of this. She was a wreck because they couldnt find him right away. She is becoming winded more easily and cannot take the long walks the boys like anymore. Often I will walk them downtown and she meets us there in the car. Wagon for when they get tired before we reach the park.\n\nShe is an AMAZING mom, wife, and partner. I am terrified of losing her and what my life and the kids life would be like without her. It keeps me up at night. \n\nShe is SUPER self concious about her weight, but I have always found her beautiful and tell her as much everyday, but I want to enjoy this life with her as long as possible. I have been to afraid to ask her to lose any weight because I dont want to hurt her self image, feelings, or make her think I dont find her attractive. She had an ex that did that and it really messed her up.\n\nShe was very thin as a child and into her early adult years, so it doesnt seem like a genetic thing. Her whole family is very fit.\n\nI feel like if I say nothing and she has a heart attack someday, I will blame myself forever for not trying to talk to her... I will feel like I failed our boys. Btw they are almsot 4 yo and 2 yo now incase that matters.\n\nI ask you reddit, specifically ladies, how can I ask her to consider diet and exercise without it becoming an issue she thinks is related to looks and physical attraction? How can I help her understand I care 0% about this issue for looks, and 100% because of health. I just dont want to hurt her.",

I can take it on myself to do more healthy dinners by just slowly changing groceries for us. I do a lot of the shopping. I have always used exercise as an excuse to eat unhealthy myself. I love the team effort idea. I can make this change about me vs her saying I think poor eatting has been affecting me negativly and say I want to try and cook healthier. I will start exercising at night in front of her maybe during some of our relaxation/ tv tome and leave it up to her if she gets interested to join in. I can push for more walks on weekends and after work with kids. The little changes can then hopefully add up for us both :) For people commenting, I will add that I know I am NOT the pinnicle of health either, but I think that almost helps give me the excuses I need to make the changes above. My wife SEES me as very physically fit however, so when I bring up wanting to lose weight she can get a bit defensive saying things like \"well if you think you need to lose weight then I must be extra fat\". Which then I try to shower her in compliments and positivity cause I feel bad.\n\nI think it could be a bit of a tight rope walk early, but I think this stuff can only help.

Hands getting dirty and they get to learn about cooking in the process. I like to change the food before tackling the portion size. Both are a recipe for disaster because you're making too much of a change. Bigger portions but lean meats and veggies are much better than big portions of fatty and fried foods. So try and take advantage of grilling and baking (air fryers if you can but even get a small rack for your cookie sheet so the fat from meats can drip down). Breakfast meats in the oven too - sausage patties and bacon on a small rack means less fats and she can plop them in and forget about them. Overnight oats are easy prep and can be healthy depending on how you make them - probably a better snack than anything in the pantry too.\n\nMake adjustments a little at a time together. Walks after dinner with the kids are a great way to burn out some of their energy and for all of you to reconnect. It doesn't have to be a lot at first. Build up to it, slowly incorporate things to make the eventual lifestyle changes you want to end up at.",

Also could go to a nutritionist if you can swing it.  Get a plan that works for your/her specific needs. Add active family stuff and then exercising together if you both want.  I personally enjoy shadow boxing with my VR headset and he's a cyclist so we can't do things together.  You do what works for your family. \n\nIf that starts moving her health in the right direction (didn't say weight-- just stronger,  more energy)... keep going.  \n\nTurned out i have a pretty big metabolic issue the new drug classes are helping with. So if traditional health stuff doesn't work,  there are new amazing options i wish i had 20 years ago.  \n\nIf your wife suffers from depression,  the turnaround in confidence from getting healthy has changed MY  life, so it might help her too as a side benefit.",

Gotta focus on the lil ones after all.\n\nWeight loss is slow. So damn slow. 1-2 pounds a week slow. Any faster and I'd have other issues.  \n\nI only check the scale once a week, in the am, after I've used the bathroom, but before I put anything in my mouth. \n\n\"Hey honey, I've noticed we aren't the most fit anymore and I'm getting scared we won't be around to witness the kids grow up...

                "body": "My wife and I have lost a combined 210lbs in the past ~2 years (80 her, 130 me), most of it being lost in the first 14 months. Here is how we did it. First of all, it's gotta be together, it can't be done alone, it's so much easier to motivate each other as you go. Second, exercise is important for general health for sure, and cardio paired with weight training allows your body to burn calories both while working out and after as your muscles recover. But weight is not lost at the gym, it is lost in the kitchen. You have 2 ways you can go. The healthy but tedious way, or the less healthy but quicker way. Personally I do a mix of both. The trick is to not go too hard or else you will burn out. If you suddenly try to switch to eating healthy all the time and going to the gym 4 times a week you will burn out almost immediately. \n\nThe healthy but tedious way: you start cooking a lot of meals from home, you can find a ton of healthy recipes on Instagram, Facebook, reddit, etc. You reduce your breakfast to something small, and eat it later in the day, some healthy snacks for lunch, then the gym and a decent dinner. Depending on how your timing works you want to try to not eat at least 2-3 hours before bed. Also depending on when you are personally the hungriest, you can move around your biggest meal. The issue with this method is that it involves a lot of cooking, coming up with ideas, buying the groceries, etc. It will involve a lot of volume eating of lean meats and vegetables and fruits. Very healthy but not easy for everyone to do. \n\nThe quicker but less healthy way: just eat less. A lot less. Like 1600 max calories a day. You're gonna feel it at first, trust me, it's not gonna feel great for a few weeks, tired, headaches, etc. But once you get past that, your body adjusts, and the weight starts to absolutely fall off. I lost 10lbs a month for a year doing this. I eat like 200-350 healthy calories (low sugar yogurt, beef jerky, string cheese) at like noon as breakfast/lunch, occasionally a 300 calorie protein shake before the gym, and then a healthy ish dinner. I will reduce my early calories or even do OMAD on days that I know I will be eating an unhealthy dinner. This allows me to still eat whatever I want at events (to a degree, you'll find that as you strive to reduce calories, you'll take less of stuff but still some, 1 slice instead of 2, 3 pieces instead of 6, etc.), Eat out a few times a week, \"healthy\" options though (sushi, chipotle, hot pot,etc. As opposed to burgers, cheesesteaks, pizza). Now I don't avoid them as much, but when I was seriously losing I tried to avoid carbs a lot. Carbs aren't bad for you but they do add water weight and that can make your losses look a lot less on the scale. Trust me when you start losing 2.5 lbs a week on the scale those victories keep you going. \n\nPersonally I do a mix. When I cook at home I tend to try to make healthier options, but I would say I do it 3-4 times a week. We also go to the gym 4 times a week. Wife has a PT, I don't like a PT personally so I just do my own thing but I know what I'm doing from previous weight training experience, you have to decide if it's something for you or not. \n\nI will admit that having children will make this a measure more difficult for you. If they're picky you may have to make them dumbed down versions of the food your make for yourself. They may not want to eat at the \"healthier\" take out places forcing you to stop two different places. You're gonna have unhealthy snacks in your house because of the kids and you're gonna have to be good about it. Maybe find healthy versions, Costco is GREAT for healthy snacks, as long as you pay attention to the macros. You should also cut out sugary drinks as much as possible, switch to 0 calorie versions. Idk if you drink alcohol but if so switch to clear liquor mixed with seltzer or a 0 calorie drink. It's just some small changes that are hard for the first month but then it's really easy once you see results. Feel free to DM me if you have any questions.",

If you take over more of the cooking you get to determine the health of your family. You mentioned you guys also do large portions of unhealthy food. Start by cooking large volume meals of lower calorie foods, I.e. salads, grilled veggies, etc. Once you have done that for a few weeks then start bringing down portion sizes.

My SO had a terrible lifestyle before and he was hearing my suggestions but disregarding them so we started watching some podcasts together and that made an impact.  \nTypically I don\u2019t believe people get as heavy as your wife without the consumption of processed foods and eating out so cut all of that out and build some healthy habits with your kids while they\u2019re young.\n\nBtw - get rid of ice cream.

        "text": "TLDR: Wife says I\u2019m \u201cclassist\u201d for correcting our son\u2019s English.\n\nMy wife (38F) and I (40F) have been married for 11 years, together for 20. We have two kiddos (7M and 2F). My wife and I grew up in very different economic conditions. I was upper middle class and my wife was working class. Together, we are now solidly upper middle and live in a high cost of living area. We built a little suite on our property where her parents live now (M&F mid-60s). \n\nI tend to correct our son\u2019s English when he uses it incorrectly. He hangs out with my in-laws a lot and picks up some bad habits, for example saying something like:\n\n\u201cI seen the ball over there.\u201d\n\nI correct him by saying something like, \u201cDo you mean \u2018I saw the ball\u2019?\u201d and he usually responds with \u201cYeah!\u201d\n\nMy wife says that I should stop correcting him because it\u2019s \u201cclassist\u201d. We got into a bit of an argument last night about it (I corrected him when my MIL was around and my wife said I made her feel bad). This is where I\u2019m pretty sure I was the asshole. I said that, regardless of how she grew up, we are now living in the world where I grew up and people in this world judge others by the way they speak and act. Our son is growing up like this too and has to have the tools to make a good impression on others. I immediately apologized, but she\u2019s pretty upset with me. \n\nI know that she is sensitive about our financial situation and feels a little guilty about leaving her roots. She has worked really hard to get us to this point (I\u2019m a SAHM and have been since our son was born) but I think she has some imposter syndrome tendencies. She deserves every cent she earns, and works with a lot of young people that are similar to how she grew up.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice on how we can overcome these sorts of issues? We generally have a wonderful relationship, but these problems have been with us since the beginning. \n\nOf note, there are other related things that she considers \u201cclassist\u201d: manners that are \u201cbeyond common sense\u201d (napkins on laps, how to sit, proper dishes), \u201cfive dollar words\u201d (the most recent was \u201cpresupposition\u201d), drinking wine at dinner, and talking about fine art. Also, spending more than $10 on 5oz of cheese, but I think that was a joke. ",

I also think your method of correcting should be modified to something like \"I seen the ball over there\" \"Oh, you saw the ball over there?\" People pick up grammar and language by listening and using it. Your son is going to naturally speak the way he hears people around him speaking. You can model the appropriate grammar without outrightly correcting him. \n\nAlso, a lot of the people on this thread are missing the nuance of language and dialects. Judging someone for their grammar is rude. Most of society does it, but it's still rude. You should keep that in mind when you're teaching your kid, because it sounds like you've fallen into the pitfall of \"you need to speak well to make a good impression\" rather than \"this is one of the many ways to make a good impression on someone.\" Additionally, the vast majority of adults don't have perfect grammar, but most people don't even notice or realize it. The most important thing is that someone is *clear*, that they're able to clearly communicate with others. \n\nFor context, I come from the backwoods of Appalachia and learned to hide my accent and dialect in college where I was surrounded by the upper class. I majored in English and I'm a professional writer and editor. When I read the way you correct your son, I cringed a bit.

Those benefits would be not dealing with racism or classism.

It's also important to lay the groundwork for proper grammar when they're young. As they get older they'll need to be able to code shift. That means you can go from speaking slang, using bad grammar and swear words with your friends to speaking proper English with proper grammar in a work situation. Just about everybody does this, although they don't necessarily identify that they do it. \n\nYears ago my sister and I were looking at renting a place together. Our new landlady called while I was hanging out with her.  I spoke to the lady professionally and we agreed to meet up and sign the lease. As soon as I got off the phone she gaped at me and said \"You sound like a grown up!\" Lol, I was 29 and she was 19 and she hadn't really seen code shifting like that before.\n\nI told my children that I know they use bad words with their friends and that I can't police what they're saying when they're not around me but they better not ever use it in front of me. It taught them how to switch it off when needed. \n\nExplain to your wife about code shifting and that it's not about class it's about your child having a foundation that makes it easy to switch. Also depending on how old your child is, let them know that it's okay to speak to their grandparents a certain way but with you it's always going to be proper grammar, just to make sure that they know both ways of speaking.

You are basically saying the way she grew up, the way people around her were talking is wrong. So, in essence working class people did it wrong.\n\nYou need to consider that of course there isn\u2019t right or wrong in the language per se. As soon as something becomes common and widely used, it becomes right. Language branches and evolves, and creates dialects in communities. One good example to set the stage is usage of word \u201chopefully\u201d - the way it is used today by most people is still considered wrong and low class by some, as well as ending sentences with prepositions, which of course is actually fine.\n\nSo her working class culture moved away from grammar book English uses to a simplified or different form. They formed a dialect but it\u2019s not wrong - it can\u2019t be, they speak and understand it. What it is it marks a person as belonging to a certain circle - working class.\n\nNow there might be situations when this dialect is inappropriate. For example, academia has rigid stylistic guidelines and won\u2019t allow this. Nor some roles in entertainment industry.\n\nIt\u2019s also true that speaking a dialect like that may make life harder because yes many people are classist and would see the speech as a social marker and act accordingly.\n\nSo in essence your wife is right, but it\u2019s not easy to communicate all of this to a child.\n\nLuckily you don\u2019t have to. At this age children will pick up on the way others speak around them, and code switch rather easily. You probably already noticed that he speaks one way in some situations and the other way in the other. For example, he will speak with his friends the way they speak, and with teacher the way they speak. It\u2019s normal, humans learn how to do it.\n\nSo perhaps I\u2019d calm myself by observing this phenomenon and seeing that he only uses the way working class speaks in certain situations, would leave it alone.

However, in order to navigate society and be taken seriously in professional and educational settings, it's an unfortunate fact of life that he'll probably have to learn how to use the standard English dialect. It's what people automatically associate with social prestige and education and they will make false assumptions and treat him differently for not using standard English. However, people can use both. One doesn't have to abandon the way they originally speak, just use different contexts to determine what's appropriate (ie, codeswitching)\n\nThere's some interesting studies and documentaries (American Tongues and Can You Speak American are good ones albeit dated) about grammar structures for different accents considered 'lower-class' (which can usually be traced to remnant forms of grammar from different languages and geographic isolation). They're valuable and if people were more open minded, they wouldn't have Linguistic prejudices. Talking differently doesn't mean someone's stupid, they just learned different language structures and communicate accordingly. Language is rather fluid and often plays with rules (slang, creoles, etc). \n\nBut I can see why your wife is upset. It's not necessarily a shameful thing to her, it's just part of how she grew up and now it's being attacked. Just be honest you're worried about how he might lose opportunities or face prejudice for not adopting a more standard dialect.

For the most part, we\u2019re incredibly aligned when it comes to values like loyalty, kindness, ambition, and the way we want to live our lives.\n\nThe only difference is politics. She\u2019s a Republican and voted for Trump both times. I\u2019m a Democrat and very much not a Trump supporter. In the early years, I brushed it off because we didn\u2019t really talk politics much.

I strongly disagree with the pro-life position, but I think it's perfectly inteligible, and obscuring that does not help.\\]\n\nMmm, I don't think so. I think they are saying their lives matter *equally.* Which means in a situation where Choice A will be guaranteed to kill a human (baby), and Choice B will cause a slight increased risk to kill a person (mother), the second choice is preferable. Take the slight risk over the guarantee.\n\nI think someone who is prolife would say - of course I don't support suicide. But there are ways to help people feel less depressed that don't involve killing a child. If I say, \"my boss is an asshole, I'd be less depressed and suicidal if he was dead\", that does not justify me murdering him, even if its true. We don't get to kill other people for our own mental health.\n\nI think for them, the difference is about innocence, and responsibility. Except in cases of rape and incest, which most pro-life folks support exceptions for, women have made choices that have led to the pregnancy. Unborn children have not. It's the person who bears no responsibility for a difficult situation who should not also be forced to bear its costs.\n\n(also worth considering - is it really life experience that makes a human life valuable? is an elderly person inherently more valuable than a younger person? is a newborn nearly worthless because it has so little experience? can you love something before it is born? can a baby who does not understand language and cannot track with its eyes, but can recognize its mother holding it, love? can an unborn baby love? how can we know?)",

I agree that a centrist policy position here is not appropriate. I can also see clearly that the pro life movement does have broad appeal for a lot of people in my country, and it matters to me to think about how I can reach them. Categorizing their beliefs as bizarre and nonsensical is not a useful way to do that. It also isn't accurate. People can be wrong and still be understandable.\n\nI think calls to violence are supremely unhelpful and only serve to radicalize the opposition. Contributing to the perspective on the other side that they are fighting a holy battle, that they are being persecuted, makes this problem *worse,* it makes all of this more appealing for them.   \n\n\nThe question of *what does it mean to be a person* is not something that can be empirically proved, it's a philosophical question.\n\nI think diving into these questions matters. It's important not just to convince people, but to shape policy around abortion access itself and make it strong. Part of why Roe v Wade was able to be overturned is because the specific logic underpinning it was weak. Grounding the right to abortion until a fetus is \"viable\" carries a lot of problems - what is viability? How likely does it have to be for a fetus to survive outside the womb to be viable? What risk of physical deformities and disability is acceptable? What about the acceleration of modern medicine in terms of care for NICU babies? Earlier and earlier pregnancies are becoming \"viable\" due to medical advancements - does that decrease the right to abortion (it certainly was used that way in a lot of Southern states)? At the time of Roe, viability was usually considered to be around 7 months, that has dramatically changed. We could not draw a line at all, but that risks losing public support - most people do not support unrestricted third trimester abortion. And it gives rise to other questions - what is the difference, really, between a baby a week before it has been born and a week after?\n\n  \nI don't think these are unanswerable questions and I have my own opinions about laws could/should be shaped. But I don't think avoiding them by painting all opposition as completely unintelligible and the pro-choice position as \"obvious\" without elaboration is helpful.",

Again, *I do not agree with this,* but I find it relatively straightforward. \"Sex has negative consequences for young people and society, it is morally harmful, therefore we should not encourage it.\"\n\nWhile some pro-life people are against sex ed, it's not entirely accurate to say that most of them are against it. Some pro-life groups and people support comprehensive sex education. Broader pro-life views are fairly diverse. They overwhelmingly support birth control.\n\nAs far as people who are pro-life don't give a shit about struggling mothers or children, these people *absolutely exist,* but as far as them being the majority of people who are pro-life, citations?\n\nMany pro-lifers (and people, generally) do believe others have a responsibility to try and make thoughtful choices about whether or not to participate in consensual sex, and that people are responsible for the consequences of those choices. They would see consistency in the positions of \"someone else should not be legally allowed to kill their own child out of convenience\" and \"I am not obligated to financially support a strangers child\". They would see them as very consistent - abortion is an attempt to escape responsibility for poor choices when you should be supporting the child you made, asking others to care for the child is an attempt to escape responsibility for poor choices when you should be supporting the child you made.  This is, again, something I disagree with (consent is complicated, a huge number of unplanned pregnancies happen to teen mothers with much older \"boyfriends\", we all benefit from providing social safety nets without trying to filter for \"fault\", fault is just complicated as fuck when our society has so much disparity and suffering, etc etc etc) but it is something I find fairly clear and understandable.\n\n  \nAnd many of them care pretty deeply about struggling families and children.",

I've never met one who, when faced with a burning fertility clinic, would actually choose to save a tray of frozen embryos over a crying baby. \n\nFurther, most pro-lifers have exceptions in which they think abortion is permissible. Not just life of the mother, but situations like SA. And if you ask them what the difference is, it consistently comes down to women taking responsibility for their actions.  If they thought that embryo was a human being, that personhood wouldn't hinge on whether or not their mother slept around. \n\nNot to mention, the idea that life begins at conception is an incredibly new idea that really has no basis in religious text. Jews broadly don't believe that.  And Christians didn't either until infant mortality started dropping in the mid 1900s. Before that, Catholics didn't even record a date of birth until a child's christening when they were confident they'd be sticking around. Hell, Immanuel Kant, a Christian philosopher raised in a deeply religious household dedicated to a literal reading of the Bible, advocated for lenient treatment of *maternal infanticide* on the grounds that it could not be considered murder. \n\nI've known a lot of pro-lifers and I know what they say to justify themselves. But their position isn't intellectually or morally honest.",

It is thoughtful and persuasive especially wrt fertility clinics, which are an example I've brought up with pro-life folks before. I also really think that the history of the anti-abortion movements needs to be more broadly taught.\n\nI do think wrt fertilized eggs - we've seen just how fucked up six week abortion bans can be because they are SO early, by the time women really have a reasonable chance at making the decision around whether to abort or not babies are far beyond the fertilized egg stage. Very easy to pull heartstrings with the whole \"ohhhhh the baby has a heartbeat now, it has a little fist\" etc etc etc. People might not run in for fertilized eggs but they might run in for, I don't know, some fucking sci fi womb shit with fetuses that were at the point they looked like tiny babies, which happens early. Eight week fetuses look pretty babyish. (Kind of related - the 14 day embryo research rule).\n\nJews actually explicitly don't believe in life starting at conception, which you can tell because the Torah prescribes the punishment for assaulting a pregnant woman and causing her to miscarry, and it is a MUCH lower punishment than for murder.\n\nIn the US, the anti-abortion movement was largely rooted when the ~~White Dude~~ American Medical Association was rising in power and wanted to get rid of midwives and supplant their role in womens healthcare, and scaremongering about abortion was a way they could get back territory. With that said, there's weakness in talking about the recent history - some of our better social policies (gay marriage being an obvious one) were also pretty recent.\n\n  \nThe sexual assault thing is complicated. I think for true pro-lifers, they don't actually ethically believe in abortion exceptions for sexual assault, but they understand that would make it unpalatable and so they don't push it, just like a lot of pro-choice folks (I am in this bucket) might agree that \"of course\" third trimester abortions should be limited despite not actually having a problem with them because I understand they would be a bill killer in a lot of places. I am curious what your position on this is.\n\n  \nMy experience with pro lifers has been that the ones I have known have been very sincere in their beliefs.",

As a notorious whale hater, I'd be completely immune to that argument. \n\nRight, I say \"broadly\" because there are some haredim who interpret the passage you're referring to differently, but it's a fairly tortured interpretation that doesn't really have a relationship to the values of the time. Even living children were viewed, to some degree, as parental property. It makes sense then that a fetus would be seen as, essentially, a contingent future property interest as the passage seems to indicate. Reform, Conservative and Reconstructionist orthodoxy does not view a fetus as a person, and they make up the overwhelming majority of Jews. (Not to mention that Reform actually predates Orthodox Judaism, which is really just a form of retro conservatism that arose as a reaction against the enlightenment and the emergence of Reform Judaism in the late 1800s. But I digress.) Basically, you're correct, and it's weird to me that Christians who say Jesus represents god's forgiveness also have a MORE punitive construction of Jewish texts than Jews do, especially given that virtually none of them read Hebrew and haven't the faintest idea what it actually says.\n\nPerhaps, but I think many sincerely believe in those exceptions for the reasons I mentioned, \"taking responsibility.\" I have more respect for the unpalatable position, because at least it's honest. I don't think it's possible to sincerely and morally advocate for a position that, in your own view, permits the killing of SOME babies in order to secure a political victory. I see what you're saying re third trimester abortions, but I personally don't argue my position that way. I don't concede to restrictions on late term abortions because non-medical policies that restrict a doctor's discretion make medical personnel afraid to provide necessary medical care in emergency situations for fear of prosecution, and women die as a result. Although Ireland did allow abortions in cases of maternal mortality, Savita Halappanavar was denied an abortion while she was actively miscarrying and facing a life-threatening infection because her fetus still had a heartbeat. She died of sepsis after actively miscarrying for *seven days*. Similar policies have also lead to maternal deaths in the United States. Instead, I say that nobody gets a late term abortion because they want one. Women seeking late term abortions are there because they have a wanted pregnancy that is not viable, or is viable but killing them. And we know for a fact that limiting a doctor and patient's discretion in these situations is often a death sentence.\n\nI think the opposition sometimes comes from a place of emotional sincerity. I don't think it's always purely political. I do, however, think pro life people aren't being honest with themselves about what the thoughts underpinning that feeling really are. In nearly all cases, I just don't think it's really about the child, but about punishing a woman for failing to live up to the role of a nurturer and caretaker. And that's without getting into people who oppose abortion (many of them religious) because they view young unwed mothers as baby mills for infertile couples. This often goes hand in hand with medical racism, classicism and eugenics. I had a distant cousin who was an obstetrician, vehemently anti-abortion and disapproved of birth control,  who nonetheless performed *involuntary sterilizations* on patients he deemed unfit for motherhood or undeserving of more children. (Also goes hand in hand with Elon Musk's apartheid-adjacent tittering about the declining white birthrate.)",

Conservatives who find Trump repulsive, but voted for him anyway due to the abortion issue. They feel passionately about it, and I disagree with them deeply, but it's weird seeing all the arguments down this thread of people being like \"why do pro lifers never give a shit about single moms and kids though???\" as though nobody REALLY believes that fetuses really are children, that their beliefs are not genuine somehow. Idk man, my family has gone pretty out of their way to be supportive of the kids and struggling moms in their community. They care a whole lot. They didn't pick their beliefs to troll people. They have reasons for believing what they do (deeply religious, also immigrated from south america which leads to Opinions on anything that looks like communism which makes them distrust democrats even further). They genuinely feel that abortion is murder and are horrified by the fact that murdering innocent children is legal and something \"the other side\" champions, and it leads to them struggling to empathize with the left or see them as moral.

And while Trump may be laughable, he has never once said anything wry, witty or even faintly amusing \u2013 not once, ever.\nI don\u2019t say that rhetorically, I mean it quite literally: not once, not ever. And that fact is particularly disturbing to the British sensibility \u2013 for us, to lack humour is almost inhuman.\nBut with Trump, it\u2019s a fact. He doesn\u2019t even seem to understand what a joke is \u2013 his idea of a joke is a crass comment, an illiterate insult, a casual act of cruelty.\nTrump is a troll. And like all trolls, he is never funny and he never laughs; he only crows or jeers.\nAnd scarily, he doesn\u2019t just talk in crude, witless insults \u2013 he actually thinks in them. His mind is a simple bot-like algorithm of petty prejudices and knee-jerk nastiness.\nThere is never any under-layer of irony, complexity, nuance or depth. It\u2019s all surface.\nSome Americans might see this as refreshingly upfront.\nWell, we don\u2019t. We see it as having no inner world, no soul.\nAnd in Britain we traditionally side with David, not Goliath. All our heroes are plucky underdogs: Robin Hood, Dick Whittington, Oliver Twist.\nTrump is neither plucky, nor an underdog. He is the exact opposite of that.\nHe\u2019s not even a spoiled rich-boy, or a greedy fat-cat.\nHe\u2019s more a fat white slug. A Jabba the Hutt of privilege.\nAnd worse, he is that most unforgivable of all things to the British: a bully.\nThat is, except when he is among bullies; then he suddenly transforms into a snivelling sidekick instead.\nThere are unspoken rules to this stuff \u2013 the Queensberry rules of basic decency \u2013 and he breaks them all. He punches downwards \u2013 which a gentleman should, would, could never do \u2013 and every blow he aims is below the belt. He particularly likes to kick the vulnerable or voiceless \u2013 and he kicks them when they are down.",

You'd rather live in your insulated bubbles and echo chambers rather than actually contend with the cognitive dissonance of having to consider you are WILDLY out there in space. Either I'm just a unicorn and truly one of a kind in that regard, or - and really try to consider this possibility - there are millions upon millions more like me. Your group likes to boast about how smart and college educated you guys are, so what do you think is more likely? \n\n\nAs for OP, no, I don't think you should plan for a future with your conservative girlfriend. It's not because of her **perceived** \"intolerance\" of liberals, but the truly shocking amount of liberals that are the party of \"love and tolerance\", yet are devoid of either. You know, like your leaders that represent you in congress that literally refused to even acknowledge the terminally ill 13 year old boy that suffered from brain cancer given an honorary secret service award that Trump brought in - DESPITE being a minority, the same ones you insist half the country hates (\"hated\" by those that support him, \"loved\" by those who wouldn't even acknowledge his existence). Might as well mention the firebombing of tesla cars and dealerships that is apparently kosher with so many of you, on top of the millions of you that are actively calling for the **genuine MURDER of Musk and our president**. That is the accepted and **encouraged** norm for people you pass by on the street every day of your party, so much so that even your elected leaders hardly speak against it, if at all. You're literally parodies of yourselves with the abhorrent behavior you accuse people like me of doing - and there are SOME radicals that do that are extremists and absolutely in the wrong - but your *moderates* embody this as the status quo, not the radicals.\n\nProper conservatives can disagree with your views but we accept and encourage your freedom to disagree and live your life as you wish, assuming it is legal and isn't objectively immoral and dangerous. That is the liberty and freedom that built this country, and even with us disagreeing we defend your right to choose. Your baseline liberal though...well, again just look for your nearest lot of burning and vandalized Teslas, your \"peaceful protests\" aka riots that cause BILLIONS of dollars of damage and destruction, calls for violence ajd murder of those you think \"deserve it', and so on. Even if you're a liberal that is staunchly against that, at absolute best, most of you still think conservatives are truly despicable, evil people. \n\nI haven't said anything false, not a thing, but i know there will be a barrage of comments and down votes berating me while somehow defending the actions your party **loves** and will somehow justify it all. \n\nHootie hooo.",

What if your daughter comes home pregnant at 15? Will she want them to go to church? \n\nTaking it back to something I didn\u2019t think about enough before having kids, but what about discipline? Don\u2019t get me wrong, before I had kids, I swore black and blue that I would spank them the way I was spanked growing up.\n\nOnce I had kids, I realised that they\u2019re just tiny humans and \u201ctantrums\u201d are just them experiencing an emotion they don\u2019t know how to deal with. If adults yell when they\u2019re angry, why do we expect toddlers to be better at handling that emotion than a grown adult?\n\nIf you want to see how awfully parenting can play out with a father who just lets his wife have free rein with disciplining the children, Google \u2018Ruby Franke.\u2019",

And morals can be thrown back and forth all day by party and candidate. I know the vast majority dislike trump. So be it. All of the issues being dealt with were compounded by previous administrations with open borders and alot more. One of the largest problems with ALL democrat politicians is their bought by soros. You can see the soros manipulation with the chaos his open borders policies have caused in Europe. Thank God it's being pu a he'd back here. That said, giving up on anyone you love due to how they vote and not allowing them their choice when you get along in every other way is pathetic. The problems some say are or will come up are like scare tactics from the dnc playbook. The tolerant side or self labeled tolerant side just deletes what they don't like here anyway. The very thoughts and accusations as to how someone may raise their child is garbage. You raise them with the freedom to make educated choices based on truth. How can anyone get a decent answer to a question from anyone who may promote hatred and destruction of property belong to others. Or is it for some idiotic reason acceptable? Quite a mess. I would be embarrassed to allow politics to sway my love for anyone especially if you really do love them.",

WHO TF IS SOROS AND POSSIBLY EVEN THE WEF TO SAY TO OPEN BORDERS EVERYWHERE? and this has been happening for decades. And to what end? Soros and the elites want collapse everywhere because NOWHERE that liberal soros bought politicians is better off and his plan is still in the earlier years. Then the left has used the term CLIMAT MIGRATION! bullshit it's migration promoted by soros. And I haven't even mentioned the fraud waste and embezzlement, nepotism and money laundering found. And guess what, That's wtf was funding alot of the soros groups. When all is done and said the democrats will be lucky to have a party. Why would anyone vote for them? They don't even hold primaries! Why? They need fools who are greedy, corrupt and Soros controlled! That's why their so unbelievably frantically. Anyway the markets are down. So YALL can't say Trump is only for the rich because his actions, which I agree with have hit the rich the hardest. They own like what the top 50% of shares? Now being the market is down, you should invest in crypto or stocks. Because shortly it's going to go thru the roof. Crypto be careful. I can't suggest or advise but pay attention to XRP. call it a gesture of good faith. But remember  we all have our views and were not all bad but sometimes we receive poor information and that sucks.

I do personally believe that such weapons are not \"assault weapons\", but several states define them under their laws as such. It's ironic because they're some of the least likely weapons to be used in an assault.\n\n>it\u2019s an automatic rifle. The AR-15 fires one shot per trigger pull.\n\nSorry to nitpick, but that would be a semiautomatic rifle that fires once per function of the trigger. There are things like the binary trigger that will fire when the trigger is pulled and fire again when the trigger is released/reset but is still semiautomatic under federal law.\n\n>Assault weapons fire continuously while the trigger is held down. Unless you\u2019re illegally modifying your AR-15?\n\n\nThe term is actually \"assault rifle\". Assault rifles are defined as magazine fed rifles chambered in an intermediate cartridge that has select fire capability (safe, semi, automatic).\n\nThere are devices like [Forced Reset Trigger](https://youtu.be/9uCoj92PUnI?si=4lJuacORo0OEofuW) which forces the trigger forward to reset it. It is semiautomatic under federal law because only one round is fired per function of the trigger.\n\n>He said high capacity, not standard capacity. I know 10 and up is generally considered \u201chigh\u201d, but I\u2019m talking like 20-30+ here. \n\nDepending on the firearm 20-30 is standard capacity. An AR-15 has a standard capacity of 30.\n\n>Registration for guns is illegal? What?\n\nYes. If I remember correctly, the Firearm Owners Protection Act makes it illegal for the federal government to keep a searchable registry of firearms. That's why they cannot digitize 4473s in a certain way that are in their possession because that would constitute a searchable database.\n\nIt's unconstitutional because there is no historical tradition of requiring registration of firearms.",

You\u2019re not overthinking it. Marriage doesn\u2019t make things easier when it comes to stuff like this.\n\nMe and my current SO went through something similar. I was raised muslim (ex muslim now) and he is jewish (secular) and the current political news cycle caused us to get into a lot of arguments over what\u2019s happening in Gaza. I\u2019m not going to get into specifics but it started eating at me and I let my partner know I couldn\u2019t stay in the relationship because we had different views on human rights. I could not in good conscience have a child with someone who thinks human rights for some people are a \u201ccomplicated\u201d issue. \n\nTalk to your girlfriend and explain how you\u2019re feeling. If they truly love you, they will hear you out. My partner at first said he didn\u2019t understand me but that he would try and for the next few months I was able to get him to see my perspective. And to my surprise he came around. I don\u2019t know if your girlfriend is capable of that or if that\u2019s something you want but for me, it saved our relationship.\n\nTLDR; sit her down and talk to her about this seriously. It\u2019s going to eat at you over the years if it\u2019s bothering you before marriage. Think about what happens if you have kids. If you\u2019re okay with her teaching your children conservative values then I\u2019d say its not a big deal. BUT if that thought bothers you DO NOT GET MARRIED",

The tipping point was when I heard his brother say \u201cI know this sounds bad but I hope they wipe out the Gaza strip\u201d in front of me and it caused a HUGE argument. After that my therapist suggested I ask my SO what Israel means to him in order to understand why his perspective changed. Prior to the trip, he did not think like this and always said that Palestinians were being treated unfairly.\n\nIn talking with my SO, I realized he had a very real\nand valid feeling of wanting to be amongst community with your own people but it got corrupted in a way that was cult like and extremely nationalistic. I asked him if he was able to speak to any Palestinians on the trip or see the West Bank and he said no and I could tell he realized how it sounded. On every other human rights issue, he completely understands but for some reason he kept saying the issue was complicated when it came to this. Israel had taken his longing for community (which he never had growing up and was made fun of for being Jewish constantly) and turned it into extreme nationalism in less than 10 days on that trip. My SO\u2019s background is eastern European and he had no family/friends in Israel prior to going on birthright so it was hard for me to understand his perspective at first.\n\nEven though he didn\u2019t understand my view, he said I was more important to him and that he wanted to try because he loves me. A few weeks ago he suggested we watch No other land and I knew that he really did change for me \ud83d\ude2d\n\nMy SO is well educated and incredibly smart but even he fell victim to the brainwashing on birthright. We are ALL susceptible to propaganda and OP\u2019s gf could be no different. \n\nIf OP truly believes his girlfriend is a good person he needs to ask her what trump means to her and get to the root cause of why she supports him.",

Hell, most LGBTQ advocates want to do away with the practice of performing \u201ccorrective\u201d surgery on infants with genitalia that don\u2019t neatly align with \u201cmale\u201d vs \u201cfemale\u201d boxes that said infants are literally incapable of consenting to.

Maybe, if they receive extensive therapy, they go on hormone blockers before they start puberty. And MAYBE once they\u2019re old enough to make their own medical decisions without a parent in the room, they can go on HRT. the benefit of puberty blockers being that they give someone more time to think about what they actually want while avoiding changes to the body that would require surgical intervention later if those changes produced significant levels of gender dysphoria (eg, breast development). \n3.

I make too much to qualify for assistance so everything I paid - inflated groceries, increase in rent, medical bills, transportation costs, etc. - I paid at 100% with no help. If I had received assistance or made over $75k I might not have felt the way I did. Anytime a democrat was in office I had less money, historically. Trump will be the only exception for me personally where I think his term will make it almost unbearable to survive and put aside money for savings (if the past few months are indicative of what\u2019s to come).",

How do you guys think he\u2019s cool?  Something to look up to? \ud83e\udd2e\n**remember when you guys liked free speech?  I member.**\n\nNow he\u2019s banned that.  Anything that hurts the egotistical, sensitive tiny feelings of our mad toddler king.  Wouldn\u2019t wanna have yet another tantrum that causes *another* world trade war.  Or just a world war.  \n\n**What we really care about are actions.  More so than words.  Illegally sending students to gulags without due process, for protesting Israel\u2019s genocide.  Taking away women\u2019s rights, gay/trans rights, and selling immigrants into slave labor, it\u2019s all fucked up.**",

Because the issue involves you two, not you two and me and us and all us keyboard warrior losers over here. Because, at the end of the day, we're not going to be at the altar with you.

Which, yeah...I suppose if you want to spend the next 40 years gritting your teeth and acting like you love the lunatic you hitched your crotch to, sure, go ahead. Because you will. Because doubts don't go away. If you don't deal with them, they just get bigger.

Absolutely *bewildering* people think political differences aren't a big deal, when your entire moral compass aligns with your politics.\n\nHow you feel about women, people who aren't white, the economy, human rights, the environment, etc. There's a LOT that is \"political\" so I can't fathom dating someone who has wildly different beliefs than I do and making that work long-term.\n\nI just don't think it *can*. The only reason it \"works\" short term is because A) the couple is really very sexual and that's the strongest part of the relationship that inevitably fades and leaves you wondering wtf you were thinking, and B) they just NEVER discuss anything deeper than a surface pass of anything political at all somehow.\n\nMy ex and I were a lot like that; we barely ever talked about politics, so when it started coming up in later years, I found his views had shifted into right-leaning way more than I previously ever thought. He'd espoused some liberal/left talking points before, and we agreed in those areas.\n\nBut then he started talking about other shit and getting weirder and more sexist and racist as time went on, which is just WILD.\n\nAnyway, he didn't like Trump, but he *hated* Kamala and very loudly complained about Democrats without complaining about nasty Republicans at all while watching Joe Rogan, Asmongold and Fox News all the fucking time, so I realized \"oh shit I'm married to a fucking Republican, gross\". Dude used to worship Elon too, probably still does.\n\nHe honestly probably always was this way and just hid it and never brought it up when I talked about my politics, because he didn't care cause he was getting his dick wet. A lot of men will date/marry women they actually *actively hate* on some level and not care if she puts out. It's terrifying to me how many men will do this.\n\nIt's really terrifying to me that I was married to someone who very likely did this for decades.

It was a mere 'shove it in your face kind of exercise'.\n\nShe was pretty and sometimes fun. Now if this description matches in any way your partner, I would run. Conservatives have very often a narrow and coercive mindset, which is going to make you feel locked in a cage at some point.

When we first started dating, we both identified as right leaning (me more so than him), but over the years he's become more left-leaning. I've always firmly believed that you shouldn't even bother dating someone if they have vastly different political, religious, etc. beliefs. If I'm brutally honest on one thing in particular, if past-me knew that in a few years my husband would eventually identify as a liberal, I probably never would have bothered dating him. \n\n\n\nBut I'm eternally grateful that I did.\n\n  \nHe's one of the most amazing people I've ever met. He's kind, affectionate, intelligent, values fairness, and isn't afraid to be romantic and sweet with me. Some of the things I love most about him reflect the fact that he's left leaning. \n\n  \nHe ultimately hated (and still hates) the petty name calling that both sides are guilty of. I grew up in a family that wasn't afraid to trash talk the other side, so to me, it was pretty normal. But I've come around to agreeing with my husband. I do think it's sad just how incredibly divided America has become. Especially when we're all just human beings just trying to do our best in life. In recent years, thanks to my husband, I've gone from being far right, to more \"ambivalent right\". \n\n\n\nWe can have the best of intentions when voting or choosing who to look up to, but later discover that that person has a lot of skeletons in their closet. Probably most celebrities and famous people we know have some dark secrets.    Neither my husband or I were ever super into politics like others. We have our beliefs, but aren't the types to enjoy discussing political things for fun. We value the people we know personally in our lives, and focus on what we want to do personally with our lives. Because ultimately, in the grand scheme of things. . .We're all tiny specks in the universe.\n\n  \nI'd rather befriend others who may or may not have the same beliefs as me, rather than cut others out who have different opinions. Some of my closest friends are also very liberal. They're also amazing people. Things are going strong between my husband and I because we respect that we have different political beliefs. Have we had some heated arguments in the past on politics? Yes. Are things better now? Also yes. People change, and that's one thing that can sometimes be scary and inevitable about marriage. You can choose who your partner is today, but that means you're also choosing future-them. And you won't know who that person is until you meet them. It's best to accept them for who they are now, but also understand that they're going to shift in personality to some extent over the years. Of course if it's drastic, I don't think that's something you should have to tolerate (like if they become a bad person, cheat, lie, abuse, etc.). \n\n  \nUltimately it's up to you to choose whether you're okay with marrying someone who's a republican. The popular answer is that you should never marry someone who has vastly different beliefs and values. I think there's definitely a lot of truth to that. Normally, I would agree with that. However, I don't think it's naturally doomed either. I think it ultimately boils down to how important these things are to you and your relationship with this person. Personally, I love my husband more than my need for him to be a conservative.",

However, I also know people who are die hard for their political party, and that would never fly with them. \nIf you\u2019ve been thinking about it more and more than it must matter a lot to you in which case I don\u2019t think it would work out. I mean when crazy things in the world happen like Roe versus Wade for example getting overturned if she\u2019s coming home and celebrating and you\u2019re coming home and sulking, I think that would cause it divide in the household.\nHowever, different people sway towards different political parties for more reasons than just one issue. Like I personally fall smack in the middle because there are things that I agree and disagree with on both parties sides. Is she heavily proclaiming to always vote Republican no matter the candidate or does she just think that Trump is what\u2019s best for the economy? I feel like that\u2019s a sole reason a lot of people voted for him. \nI would definitely have a sitdown conversation with her about this if it\u2019s been on your mind a lot because you\u2019ll need to communicate these issues if you\u2019ve never really had a true political view discussion.

You need to pick an identity or side and then hold all the views that your side tells you you ought to hold. And virtually all news media is fanning the flames of division and resentment. If you label someone as a Hilary supporter, or a Trump supporter, or a Biden supporter, a certain image of that person appears in your head, and it's not that person who put it there. .\n\nFinally, you might want to step out of your echo chamber. It's tempting to distance yourself from views which are contrary to your own, but that just results in stagnation and the reinforcement of distorted narratives.

For instance, I grew up in a hut in the jungle before we became legal refugees. We were thrown into a halfway house in the worst neighborhood in NYC. If I were to say I\u2019m republican but a Democrat who has never stepped foot in a 3rd world, doesn\u2019t know what escaping child slavery feels like, never went to a public school based under a project building- tells me what poor people of color needs- but I refute those views bc I\u2019ve lived them & offer my views, then whose views are better for human rights? Better for black and brown ppl? Bc I\u2019ve experienced a middle aged white privileged Democrat who literally just got finished shopping at EreWhon, tell me what policies she  thinks help ppl like me or the ppl I grew up with. It was highly offensive tbh. But bc she\u2019s a Dem and I lean towards the Right, somehow my views are wrong. When I told my Democrat friends 8\u2019 the Bronx  of her ideas for their opinion, they felt offended. I thought  her policies not only hurt us but keep us down & she unknowingly was super racist. Or what if I said, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with a transgender in a woman\u2019s locker room bc part of my village was a sex slave village where my mom was sold at 11 & forced to have us? And the reason we ran is bc my sisters and I were about to go from factory to sex trade work. So when my daughter and I were in the spa locker room, a trans gender person came in & penis and all was 2 ft from our naked bodies. It made me feel sexually violated from the trauma I saw growing up. Why don\u2019t my feelings matter? Or the naked woman crying that she\u2019s a grape survivor that was also in said locker room? It\u2019s unfair for someone to call me transphobic, but say they\u2019re for woman\u2019s right and fight for survivors of SA but can\u2019t understand why women would feel that way but accuse me of transphobia bc I think it shld be a place for women only. \nThere\u2019s a lot of things I\u2019m on the fence about & a lot of things bc of my experiences, I stand strong. My daughter is a lesbian and bc of the way I raised her, she literally told her gf that my hubs and I would welcome her into our family.",

This was always a known difference and we came to just not talk about it except\u2026.when Trump issues surfaced. She was totally against me getting vaccinated for Covid, made comments about grooming kids, airplanes poisoning the air, the Cabal, deep states , etc. Though we did not talk about it, she was constantly on right wing social media\nIt blew up Monday when I freaked out about the tremendous decline in my retirement account (we are both retired). This is money I have spent my whole life working for and Trump\u2019s Stupidity just wiped out.  The first thing out of her mouth was how all these countries have been abusing the US, how income taxes should not be legal, etc. All the talking points of Trumpers. I lost it. Told her I came to her in a moment of need and she chose Trump over me. I realized it has always been this, just stayed below the radar because we just did not talk about it\nI would really recommend you reconsider. She will never change no more than you will. It is a fundamental difference that will always get in the way. There really is no growth. You will spend your life wishing there was someone you could talk to and share your values",

If we can't make space for each other, listen to each other, connect with each other's values, and find common ground when it's only two of us, how do you think 300+ million of us are gonna do? \n\nI'm a moderate Democrat, and my wife is conservative. We have different opinions, and we've had some pretty heated discussions, too. \n\nLots of people will say \"you must share values\" because it's easier. But more important, I think, you must respect each other's values. \n\nNo matter who you marry, there will come a time when you have a disagreement about something and you just can't see eye to eye. This is where many couples end, if they don't have the language of compassion and respecting each other's perspective. \n\nMy wife and I have been remodelling a house together - something commonly joked about as a \"marriage killer\" - and we decided early on that when making any decision about anything, either of us saying no meant no. Whatever we go with, we have to both agree to it. \n\nSome things she cares about a lot, and others it's me. Yes, we've had some heated discussions here, too. It takes self awareness to identify that that you don't like ___ and bravery to be able to say \"No, I don't like ___\" and stick to it, even as the discussion heats up. But eventually, with this in place, a strategy comes up that you can both accept. \n\nPolitics could be like this. Politics **should** be like this. Increasingly, though, it seems people are more interested in sticking with people who \"share their values\" and don't put out the effort to find something in common that works. \n\nAnd that makes me sad.\n\nIf you love her and your story is what you say it is, marry her. Be ready to connect with what you really care about, and be ready to hear the same in her. I think you'll do fine if you don't dismiss her point of view and you honor the reasons she has her point of view, and she agrees to do the same.",

And have a similar vision to what you want your lives to look like down the road.\n\nMy wife was more conservative and I was more liberal before we married.

I hated Trump, genuinely thought of him as a joke of a man (and still do), but understood Republican values.\n\nI'm Catholic, my wife's Catholic. We think caring for people is important. We both volunteer. We also both live in an urban environment but love rural areas (I hunt, she fishes, we take camping trips every few months). My wife was never engaged in politics much, and I was mildly. I read the news every morning, she proudly didn't have news apps on her phone. We both do not use Instagram, Facebook, or most social media.\n\nSo politics was not a deal breaker for us.

If you think she has become more radical since you first began dating, the real question should be whether she\u2019s too radicalized to return to any sense of normalcy after Trump is gone. For example, can she objectively look at facts that contradict her opinion and does she accept those facts? Does she feel any sense of empathy for the people that have been hurt by trumps actions? Is she just a Republican that voted for Trump or is she legitimately drinking the maga cult cool aid? Does she blindly just accept whatever claims Trump makes as absolute truth or is she open to other opinions? Does she ever challenge the narrative trump spews? Has she ever criticized Trump? If the answer to the majority of these questions is no, then you have a tough decision to make. It\u2019s one thing if you just stated dating, and this is just who they are.

He\u2019s a proven chronic liar, horrible businessman, convicted felon, alleged sex offender, and con man, with absolutely no class and people still vote for him. \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019ve been a registered independent ever since I could vote, I just think the alt-right doesn\u2019t make any logical sense and that seems to be all there is. I tend to agree with some middle-right views, so I could get along with that but alt-right? It's just downright immoral at this point. I can always agree to disagree, but if my partner is living in another reality I just would not be able to bear it.",

Not all Republicans are MAGA and not all Democrats are social justice warriors. Maybe your views aren't THAT differing but it's the label of \"Republican/Demlcrat\" that things sound scary.

Human rights, workers rights, affordable medical, affordable education, anti-military / pro veteran -- you can't be both, pro-choice, sensible gun laws -- I'm a proud gun owner, and I think more people, properly EDUCATED and then trained with guns would make the country safer, BUT I also believe there are people, and times where people shouldn't have guns. We need to stop treating mental health as a hush-hush issue, start taking it seriously, and normalizing therapy -- one way you do that is by making it more accesible, also by creating safe ways to store your guns in times when you shouldn't have them and pathways to getting them back). Harcore republicans were always a turn off to me, and always were borderline if not full blown abusive in my experience. \n\nTo be fair, my current wife voted for Trump the first time around (before we met), because she disliked Bernie for a way he voted in the past, and hated Hillary (totally fair, I voted for Bernie, and Jill once Hillary stole money and the Dem spot from Bernie. I disliked Hillary before, but that sealed the deal for me that election). BUT she regretted her decision, and was anti-Trump when I met her. She's become even more so since we started dating as our backgrounds are different and it opened her eyes to a whole new world that she wasn't exposed to growing up, which can be the case for some people who grow up Republican.",

We had a fight because I told her \u201cYou\u2019re acting as if you\u2019ve actually learned about these issues, but in reality, some nudnik who\u2019s monetized your eyeballs just gave you a brain transplant\u201d.  It\u2019s so unattractive to me. It got completely absurd when she was belittling even the demographics she belongs to. I think it\u2019s important to recognize that current MAGA ideology isn\u2019t in a locked in state, (like traditional GOP ideology). MAGA continues to get more fact resistant, angry, vindictive and oppressive. It\u2019s heading in some kind of nastier direction and this is some kind of mid-step that we\u2019re witnessing. Every new convert drives them further. That\u2019s what makes it dangerous, imo. I couldn\u2019t tie myself to a MAGA voter forever, if for no other reason than I don\u2019t know how bad she\u2019s going to get in the future.",

It can and more than likely will lead to a fight that can make you guys start to resent each other. Your feelings and beliefs are just as valid as hers and you shouldn\u2019t feel uncomfortable or unjustified for voicing what you value. My fianc\u00e9 was also on Trumps high horse right before voting was over with, neither of us were able to vote bc our schedules just wouldn\u2019t allow it but we still had the hard talk of what he believed what he did and told me things I didn\u2019t know before and I did just the same. In my case I was able to open his eyes up more to the bigger picture than he was able to do for me and ended up changing who he wanted to vote for. It was a civil and logical conversation with no bullying or intimidation tones, just facts and our feelings on it. That helped me to understand why he was thinking of voting for him a little bit more than I knew before. I think a conversation should be had to do this and know each other\u2019s true values and intentions. If they don\u2019t align then that\u2019s when I\u2019d have to start calling it quits.

It\u2019s only going to lead to resentment because neither of you are changing your minds and in a marriage, you need to function as a unit. Having differences in hobbies, music, food, and taxes is one thing. Not having the same values and priorities is a whole different thing. This is the rest of your life and if you\u2019re thinking about having kids, ask yourself if she is a mom you\u2019d be proud to have.",

My advice is to have a frank conversation (or several conversations) on the uncomfortable stuff. For me, a deal-breaker was him not being supportive of gay marriage on a religious front, and although it was more religious than political in nature (he had always been for legal gay marriage), we almost broke up because of this until he did some serious soul-searching and research and genuinely changed his mind. However (and I know this will get backlash), I personally am okay with him being pro-life in terms of elective abortion, as this doesn\u2019t stray too far from my own personal values, though I may have a different conclusion on what the \u201cright thing\u201d is legally.

                "body": "TL;DR   You are definitely NOT overthinking!\nYou are correct. As shocking and painful as it is, there IS a \"fundamental disconnect\"; a deal-breaking one. I have just been through this very thing  except we've been together off and on for 24 yrs. & I'm [F46] and he is [M48]. Do NOT propose! Why don't you stay where you guys are and get to the bottom line. I mean, instead of avoiding it, push the issue, (in a civil, respectful way), and watch how she reacts carefully. I'm sorry to say that you are probably in for a heart-breaking, nasty surprise.\n\nWe were *finally* at the door to our beautiful shared future. We planned to get married.\n\nI don't know if the only man I've ever loved deeply changed or if I never really knew him in the 1st place. This started with us just before the 2016 election. That summer I wrote him a fucking essay on why voting for Trump would a big mistake for the country and for our wonderful, special relationship. (Everything I wrote years ago has come to pass btw.)\n\nOur relationship had 2 other deal-breaking problems. But he was willing and open to tackling those together. \n\nBut not Trump-MAGA. He wouldn't budge an inch. I explained the gravity of all this with vulnerability & with patience. \nAnd, yes, there was yelling (when he would insist on talking about politics despite our moratorium on the topic). I even literally begged him in an email to stop and really consider whether Trump-MAGA was worth destroying our relationship!\n\nI kept trying to make him see that this is NOT merely politics! This goes to the heart of what kind of a world you want, how you want to move through that world, what you will tolerate and what you find indecent. In short, it is about your personal values. He refused to listen.\n\n\nHe enjoyed provoking me all of a sudden, out of nowhere, in the middle of a perfecting lovely conversation. He gleefully said approx  \"Ha, ha! Anything was worth it to get the Supreme Court!\"\n\nNow, we both understood from day one that I, most likely, would be voting Democrat and he Republican. We never got into heated discussions about Bush v. Kerry or Obama vs. McCain etc.\n\nThis last time we were happily reunited, we were desparate not to let it slip through our fingers again. I tolerated A LOT of serious cogitive dissonance. I kept thinking \"Okay, that orange bastard has gone too far, now he'll understand what I've been and disavow him and his entire hateful, fear-based, inhumane, reactionary, fascist movement.\"\n\nBut that moment never came; not even after Jan. 6th. This is guy who seriously considered being a police officer. He actually has worked in law enforcement as a pilot in the sherriff reserves. He has a degree in Political Science from a top univ. He calls himself \"a student of history\". \n\nEvery single goddamned thing that Trump is and represents is antithetical to everything my ex has accomplished and everything he values! Or so I thought. How could this possibly happen?! \n\nI have some theories in his particular case . But the point is, no mattered how hard I tried to extend myself, be tolerant and interrogate my own biases, nothing worked.\n\nMy gut-wrenching fear was that, despite the nice, funny wonderful man I saw, he was capable of a sickening amount of cognitive dissonance, bitterness, resentment, fear and contempt.\nAnd, finally, one day he proved my fears justified. He lied to me, dismissed me, he disrespected me, neglected and belittled me. \n\nAnd the time this side of him surfaced, I thought to myself  \"SEE, SEE, I knew that his Trump support revealed important parts of his character! I *knew* it meant something, that it wasn't irrelevant!\"\nPlease don't wait for that moment with your GF. \n\nI was tormented by all the beautiful happy memories we shared; by the huge investments of time, love, effort and even money. And of course, our wonderful future. I couldn't reconcile all these things with the MAGA b.s.\n\nFinally, I had to accept that I did not trust or respect him as a person anymore. Once that's gone, all you have is 2 miserable people chained to one another for whatever insufficient reason.\nGood luck\ud83c\udf40\ud83e\udd1e",

The fact is that if/when this happens, it\u2019s going to be bad no matter what. Losing tens of millions of people would be a travesty, but no where near as staggering as losing a hundred million or more for example.

        "text": "I\u2019m at a bit of a loss and hoping someone has dealt with something similar. My husband has a long-time family friend\u2014let\u2019s call him Jack (54M)\u2014who is deeply involved in his life, and now increasingly in mine and our child\u2019s. My husband and his mum (MIL) have known Jack for over 25 years.\n\nWhen we first started dating, Jack wasn\u2019t an issue. But after we had a child, things began to feel\u2026 odd.\n\nWhenever we visit my MIL (she lives about three hours away), Jack is always there. He never hosts, never cooks, never helps tidy up. He\u2019ll have his dinner sorted, but won\u2019t lift a finger. He even has a key to MIL\u2019s house and will sometimes be there waiting for us\u2014even if she isn\u2019t in.\n\nJack is constantly trying to engage with my child in a way that feels excessive. For example, when my baby was less than a month old, Jack completely ignored the adults and just sat cooing at the baby. He often tries to hug my child in a way that makes me feel uneasy. It\u2019s like he sees himself as some sort of uncle or even a father figure\u2014and honestly, it creeps me out.\n\nTo make matters worse, MIL won\u2019t babysit unless Jack is also present. She says he will be upset that he missed put on spending time with my child. If we want her to come on a family holiday, Jack has to be invited too. Lately, my husband has started behaving the same way\u2014as though Jack must be included in everything.\n\nJack is single, has siblings and nieces/nephews, but never seems to spend time with them. He only ever wants to do things with us. He\u2019s basically become a permanent fixture in our family life, and I can\u2019t stand it.\n\nHe and my husband also run a business together, so they\u2019re very tied up professionally as well. But at what point is it okay to say, \u201cthis is too much\u201d?\n\nJack spends most evenings at MIL\u2019s house, yet despite her often mentioning jobs that need doing, he never offers to help. He just hangs around, doing very little, and still expects to be involved in everything we do.\n\nI\u2019m trying to understand this dynamic\u2014Jack and MIL have never been romantically involved, they\u2019re just \u201ccompanions\u201d\u2014but I honestly don\u2019t get why his presence is being forced into my life and my child\u2019s life.\n\nI have tried several times to discuss this with my husband. He doesn't see why I have issues with this. I don't see why he doesn't. \n\nHas anyone ever been in a similar situation? How did you deal with it, and what was the outcome?",

It\u2019s an important distinction that child advocates encourage.  \n\nhttps://www.childrensadvocacyproject.org/blog/81-secret-vs-surprise\n\nAlso and I hate to say it, but it applies to all children - make sure you teach them and make sure they are comfortable with the proper anatomical names for the different parts of their bodies.  There is no shame in calling a penis a penis, a vagina a vagina or an anus an anus.   It removes shame and ensures that if a child needs to tell an adult something there is no ambiguity about what they are saying. \n\nAnd consent - r/thesaintedmartyr raised this, but as a parent you need to check adults out loud and in front of your children when they overstep.  Oh Uncle Jack wants a hug?  Well, too bad for Uncle Jack.  If your child seems reticent - stop the contact, ask them if they want to hug Uncle Jack and if their response isn\u2019t an unqualified \u201cyes\u201d - then *you* tell Uncle Jack that he\u2019s not getting a hug.  Overtly back up your child\u2019s decision, it will give them confidence and know that you are in their corner.  Be rude about it if you need to.\n\nMaybe ask if they want to give Uncle Jack a fist bump.  If the answer is no, then tell Uncle Jack he needs to back off in a way that clearly conveys that if he so much as breathes on your child, you will personally tear out his trachea with your teeth.   \n\n\u201cJack, [name] doesn\u2019t want to interact with you right now.  I expect you to respect their decision.  If you approach them, they will come to me and tell me.  (Aside \u201cRight [name]?  You\u2019ll come and tell me?)  We are here for (event) so let\u2019s make the best of it, but you will stay away from [name].   Are we understood?\u201d\n\nMake sure your child sees that - there is no room for polite deflection where your child is concerned. \n\nIn doing so, they know you understand their feelings and will protect them at any cost. It\u2019s also unlikely that Jack will attempt to cross you after you confront him.",

It's heartbreaking and hard, because we both love children. Our friends have kids and I love to shower them with hugs and attention to their comfort level. As of yet, no one has had any problems and I often get apologies for their kids being overly affectionate towards me (I wave it off and absolutely keep things appropriate with the kids).\n\nWhat are some good ways to ensure their parents are at ease?

Maintaining healthy boundaries. Not totally disregarding the parents in favor of fawning over a baby. And understanding that you do not have a right to have access to a kid, whatever that looks like--being okay if a kid doesn't want to hug you all of a sudden after being fine with it previously, or if your parent friends sometimes err on the side of being overly cautious. It's the calculus of weighing the possibility of an adult's hurt feelings over the safety of their child. It's also really easy to get excited about \"omg new baby!\" but engaging with your parent friends as adults and talking to them about things besides their kid also helps. \n\nIt's unfortunately not a one and done \"pass this test and you're good\" kind of deal. Parents have to constantly be attuned to their kids' surroundings and aware of how possible hazards change as their kids mature. It's more of an ongoing dialogue where you prove yourself to be someone who's trustworthy as things come up. It sounds like you're on the right track right now. Kids don't have as much experience to rely on in terms of \"is this a safe person\" and a lot more about it is instinctual. If they're initiating hugs etc. you're probably doing just fine.",

I secretly believed there was something deeply wrong with me, bc I didn't want to be a girl, but neither did I want to be a boy. I was ashamed and never spoke of it to anyone. The memory surfaced when I was on a painkiller (too much)  and this door in my brain just flung open and there it was. I VERY suddenly understood the WHY. There was never anything wrong with me at all. I dealt with it through therapy, but just be aware of the age difference. I was maybe 3 or 4, the memory occurred at 52. For 48 years, I thought there was something wrong with me. My Mom was gone, and I couldn't tell her. I shared it with my stepmom and she immediately gasped. She had suspected something may have happened, and she watched me closely after that, and eventually decided that she would not bring it up unless I did someday as she didn't want to force more trauma upon me.\n\nMy point is, all it took was a short window of opportunity. 100% trust your gut.",

I spent nearly every day with her as my nanny and even started calling her Mama. She was there for my first steps. She had 2 sons and always said I was her daughter, or the daughter she never had. Apparently this freaked the fuck out of my paternal grandmother to the point that she raised the concern that this woman might actually, genuinely attempt to kidnap me (there were several big news stories about this in the 80s and 90s). She was deeply uncomfortable with how \u201ccommitted to the bit\u201d D was that I was part of her family and how attached I was to her. \n\nLong story short, I am aunty to Ds grandchildren and I just tell everyone she\u2019s my godmother and her sons are my godbrothers now because that explains our relationship easier. I have to rotate my christmases between 3 families. The kidnapping story is a funny memory now. That all being said, \u201cJack\u201d is extremely different from D.

                "body": "Your intuition is screaming at you. I\u2019ve had this discussion with grown men in the context of a school counselor that their daughters thought was creepy. The men thought, \u201che seems like a nice guy\u201d, and continually dismissed their concerns as being nothing more than the musings of dramatic teenage girls looking for something to gossip about. I explained to them that their girls have had to grow up feeling uncomfortable of the male gaze for way longer than they could ever imagine, starting well before puberty. They\u2019ve had to deal with men who are perfect strangers going out of their way to engage with them in every kind of setting possible. Usually, these types of men are either unable to read that they are uncomfortable with the interaction, or they dismiss them as just \u201cbeing shy\u201d\u2026 They are the, \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong? I\u2019m not gonna hurt you, im just sayin hi,\u201d types. Both the good and bad actors here typically double down on their behavior either way, so their girls have had to learn how to pick up on the nuances that can often go unnoticed to protect themselves and are likely quite good at it by now. They\u2019d do better by them if they really paid attention and listened to their concerns.\n\nBut on the surface, it can all seem totally innocent though, right? He\u2019s just being friendly! Yeah maybe that\u2019s true, but I had to explain to these fathers that it\u2019s not what is said, but maybe it\u2019s a stare that goes on too long, or that he leans in way too close when talking to them\u2026. Maybe he\u2019s known to come up behind them while they are sitting and puts a hand on their shoulder, or lightly and \u201caccidentally\u201d grazes them with their chest briefly while checking their work\u2026. Maybe he seems to go out of his way to be in the same places as them and has to assertively engage with them every single time they cross paths even though their body language screams I\u2019m in a hurry please not today. Sometimes it completely benign but when you\u2019ve been on the receiving end of such behavior your whole life on a consistent basis, you intuitively know the difference.\n\nThe way this guy moves and the vibes he asserts on your husband, MIL, and now you and your child are making you uncomfortable. It sounds like a strange dynamic tbh. Your MIL can be friends with whomever she wants to, your husband can too to degree. If they both can\u2019t see any issues with him, that\u2019s one thing, but your husband should not gaslight you into thinking that there are no issues here because he doesn\u2019t see it and ignore your requests for reasonable boundaries. Even if this guy is completely harmless, his constant presence has become intrusive to your marriage and family life. Your desire to see less of him should be respected, period. \n\nAnd btw\u2026. It turns out the counselor was a creep, so much so that he was fired for it a few years later. I know your situation isn\u2019t exactly the same as this example, and I know that intuition isn\u2019t exclusive to one gender only, but perhaps that in your situation your cumulative life experiences as a woman are allowing you to tune into nuances your husband just can\u2019t see yet. The kind of nuances that are difficult to put into words without sounding paranoid. Always follow your gut when it comes to the safety of your child and don\u2019t relent to pressure from your husband and MIL when it comes to ensuring a safe environment for your kid. You won\u2019t live to regret being wrong here as much as the alternative.",

Because nothing you\u2019ve actually described sounds creepy. Sounds like normal stepdad type behavior from a guy who likes kids and has been part of the family for years. I\u2019m actually confused by all the pearl clutching reactions because you sound\u2026 strange\u2026 to me. Like I just don\u2019t get why you think this is so inappropriate. You keep saying he\u2019s not with his own family \u2014 uh\u2026 maybe he doesn\u2019t like them or feel as close to them?! \n\nAnd how do you *know* he and MIL are not \u201cromantic\u201d? I ask because my grandmother had a \u201cJack\u201d who was around for many years. We all thought he was a nice man who accompanied her to events and did some handyman stuff and helped her babysit etc. If you asked any of us we would have said absolutely no way were they \u201cinvolved.\u201d We found out when she died and we read her journals (she said we could! We\u2019d been waiting decades! It was awesome and she always grinned mischievously when she talked about how many giggles she got imagining us finding all her secrets in the future!) that they were **very** involved. But my grandmother did not want to remarry (that REALLY shocked us!) and she was very private about her personal life. As far as she was concerned it was absolutely no one\u2019s business what they did or did not do. Now maybe your MIL and Jack are not involved. But maybe they are. Or maybe they are just close companions. But I can\u2019t figure out why you think it\u2019s so nefarious that this guy who has clearly been around forever as a loved family member is *still* around. Absolutely nothing you described sounds creepy or weird at all. I\u2019m floored at the people suggesting Jack molested your husband \u2014 what the fork?! Maybe your husband doesn\u2019t get what your problem is because he knows Jack well and thinks you\u2019re nuts. \n\nMaybe I\u2019m wrong and Jack is a creep. But maybe you\u2019re just reading all of this entirely wrong. It sounds like the main reason you\u2019re upset is because you don\u2019t understand Jack and MIL\u2019s relationship. You don\u2019t have to! That\u2019s their issue! For whatever reason, MIL wants him around. And apparently your husband does too. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t put down any ultimatums either. If my spouse started saying our kids couldn\u2019t see a beloved family friend I was in business with because he thought it was strange he\u2019s hanging around since the family friend isn\u2019t in what my spouse considers an approved relationship structure, I would tell my spouse to seek help. \n\nReally examine what your problem is with this situation. It sounds like it\u2019s because you are not viewing Jack as the de facto family member your MIL and husband do. Would any of this be an issue if they were married? Sounds like it wouldn\u2019t. \n\nJust contemplate it. You don\u2019t want to start a huge war over nothing.",

        "text": "Im F/25, and he\u2019s M/25\nWe've been together for almost 3 years now, and I\u2019ve noticed that he has this habit of rushing me with almost everything. I\u2019m not even a super slow person. Like when we're about to go out, when he's picking me up (even when I\u2019m still at work), or when we\u2019re going somewhere. I guess during our first year together, he wasn\u2019t really like that.\n\nEvery time he acts like that, I start to feel anxious. Even when his family is around, he still acts that way\u2014and of course, I end up feeling embarrassed. Like he\u2019ll make it obvious that he's in a hurry, and sometimes he\u2019ll say things like \u201churry up,\u201d \u201cfaster,\u201d or \u201cyou\u2019re so slow\u201d with an annoyed tone, and sometimes he raises his voice, pushed me a little or gets annoyed. I\u2019ve told him many times that I don\u2019t like being treated that way, especially when he raises his voice, slams things around, or acts all agitated\u2014especially when other people can hear or see it.\n\nOne time, we were going out with his family and I was at their house. I got so mad at him when he banged on his window as a sign for me to come out, when I was literally just about to step out. I was only waiting for everyone to get ready, and I felt a bit shy around his family, so I just stayed in his room while waiting (the garage is right in front of his window). He slammed it so loudly, and I\u2019m sure his family in the living room heard it.\n\nThen just recently, I asked him to pick me up after work (btw, I work in healthcare). I told him what time to pick me up, but of course, being in healthcare, something unexpected happened\u2014a patient had complications. So I made him wait for about an hour until the patient stabilized. He kept messaging me saying he would leave at a certain time if I wasn\u2019t out yet, because apparently I told him I\u2019d be done by then. It\u2019s not like I wanted that to happen. I got so frustrated and told him so many things\u2014like, can\u2019t he try to understand or wait? He knows I work in healthcare. It\u2019s not like I wanted that to happen. When I wait for him, I rarely complain. \n\nHe did wait for me, but when we were driving, he drove so fast that I felt dizzy and nauseated. And he was giving me the silent treatment the whole time (I also already told him I don\u2019t like it when he drives too fast and keeps overtaking). I just felt even more exhausted and irritated. I was already tired from work and stressed about the patient.\n\nI don\u2019t know\u2026 sometimes he\u2019s okay. But that\u2019s really one of my issues with him. I can\u2019t figure out his attitude. I still want to be with him, but I\u2019m getting tired of the negative emotions and feelings I get every time he acts that way.\n\nHelp me please\u2026\n",

Never yelled but would definitely ask me if I'm ready like 10 times. I put my foot down and told him how it stresses me out to be rushed this way, and that it would mean so much to me if he prioritized our relationship over his desire to move life faster (I'm talking about even rushing me to get out of the car once he puts it in park even though we weren't late or anything). He got the message, and now even if we might be late he has totally let it go. I have no idea how but he's much more patient now and it's a huge game changer for us. I'm encouraging myself to move a little quicker because I don't want to let him down and make us late. All this to say, yelling and throwing is NEVER okay. That behavior needs to end immediately. You're not children who throw tantrums when you don't get what you want. Adults can express themselves with normal voices and without violence, expect that of your partner and yourself. Nor should you be embarrassed that your bf can't control his temper. And his family accepting his behavior and not seeking to protect you/tell him he's behaving inappropriately is also a red flag about them. You have the right to control your time and how long you take to do things, don't let anyone shove you into their schedule when you are perfectly happy with your own.",

The biggest way this would come out was when I was rushing people. My brain worked 20x faster than most people's, and I would even get frustrated when talking to others because I'd want them to get to the point faster. \n\nI would drive my parents crazy because I couldn't sit still and be patient about anything. If I had something I wanted to do or a place I had to be, I had to leave NOW. When I got older, a friend mentioned that their dad (whom they suspect has untreated adhd) does the exact same thing. \n\nAs I got older and into my 20s, this started to fade. When I was finally medicated, it stopped immediately. I apologised to my family for being such a brat for my childhood and teens. I only ever acted this way with them because they were the people I was most comfortable with. \n\nI think your boyfriend might be doing this with you because after one year of being together, he is more comfortable with you. Do you know if he has adhd or does he have some signs of it? It might help to get it checked out if so. Being medicated has been life changing. \n\nRegardless, it's not an excuse for his being a complete dingus, so he needs to mature. He's literally a 25yo man-child having a tantrum.",

                "body": "It sounds like you two are in a very unhealthy relationship dynamic. I don't think there is anything ok in the way he is acting: silent treatment, refusing to discuss issues, not giving closure when you have a problem with each other but just pretending everything is fine, slamming things, driving fast. These all feel like ways in which he makes sure that you feel his anger. Is he just upset with you all the time and it just bubbles over? \n\nAnother question I have is, well... are you late all the time? Is this an ongoing issue in your relationship and he's just beyond frustrated? I can imagine that finding yourself waiting for your partner ALL the time can get really frustrating - as if your time is less important than theirs. Waiting an hour to pick someone up at work can get old really fast. For instance, I used to pick up my partner at work sometimes and it would annoy me that as soon as I said I was there, he would start packing up but then go to the bathroom before coming down. So that meant I always had to wait a few minutes. He knew I was on my way - why not go to the bathroom before I got there?? I think I solved it by letting him know before I got there what my ETA was. He probably thought, what's the big deal about an extra minute or two... or three? But it GETS SO OLD SO FAST when you are the one waiting. He's got a different job now, so that's no longer an issue.\n\nI want to make it clear, even if all that is true, it does not excuse his behavior. His behavior is still NOT OK. There still is a fundamental problem in your relationship with how conflict is handled.",

He waited 1 hour, my co-worker even asked me to stay for another 1 hour, but i refused since i knew he was outside and waiting for me.\n\nI thought he\u2019ll understand since, when we are usually together.

His behavior is definitely the latter. \n\nThreatening you with leaving you at your workplace and holding you against an arbitrary timeline while you're actively working to help someone? Unacceptable. Manipulative. Goes way beyond simple personal preferences and being impatient. \n\nThis is straight up intimidation and control. \n\nIf he had somewhere else to be he could have said, \"Hey babe, I know you're still working but I'm getting really nervous that I'm going to be late to XYZ, is there someone else who can come get you? I may have to leave.\" OR \"Hey babe, I know you're still working, but I'm just wondering how long you think you might be. I'm just trying to set my expectations since I've been out here for a bit.\"\n\nThere's no reason to escalate or to be threatening.\n\nI also want to kindly point out that in your own post you say that his behavior makes you anxious and embarrassed and that he doesn't take it seriously or change when you tell him things that make you uncomfortable. That's not normal, loving partner behavior. You deserve better than that.\n\nYou don't have to stay and put up with it. I did, and it took me five years to get away from it. Fifteen years later I'm still healing.....My fear for you is that this will get worse over time. I hope you find the willingness to leave now while you can and that you find someone who will treat you with the love and grace and patience you deserve. You are worthy of good, healthy love.
